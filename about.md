We are Kiwis con attitude and carne. Our first reason to exist: create for & inhabiting one of the best bar of Brussels, the Pantin. This simple website (eager to be stuffed with any shenanigans...) will be a journal of our little experiments in coding for and from this glorious pub. Stay tuned! 

Upcoming here, a presentation of the team!
