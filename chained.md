Once upon a time, a handsome prince and his trusty steed arrived at the edge of a forest, curious about what new adventure was awaiting them. The prince dismounted, sight, took a sip of Absolute Vodka, shared with his horse and wondered aloud "Why the **** am I back here?!".

Curious to know the following, or to see what other story is in stock? For that you'll need to form a chain.

Chained is a story telling art project that unveil a story bits by bits by forcing you to interact with other people. You first get a piece of the story on your smartphone by following a link or a QR code. A link/QR code will appear for you to get to the next piece of the story. Alas you can't access it from phones that were previously used to access this branch of the story. How many people do you know in your surroundings? Hopefully enough to get to the end of the story!

Chained's concept is still a work in progress and will evolve along its creation at Le Pantin. I would want there to be illustration (abstract? Generated?) along the story, maybe a generative story line, maybe a time limit to get to the next piece of the story... We'll see!
